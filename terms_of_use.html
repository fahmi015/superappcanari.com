          <p class="mt-2 text-sm leading-8">
            Our objective is to link you to the restaurants we partner with ('Partner Restaurants') and allow you to order Items for delivery (our “Service”). Where you order from a Partner Restaurant, canari super app acts as an agent on behalf of that Partner Restaurant to conclude your order from our Application and to manage your experience throughout the order process. Once you have placed an order, your Items will be delivered to you by canari super app (“Canrai Delivery”) or our Partner Restaurant (“Partner Delivery) (each a “Delivery”) depending on the Partner Restaurant you have selected. In some cases, the Partner Restaurant may be owned by or affiliated with us.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-6 text-base font-semibold leading-7 text-orange">Your Account</p>
          <p class="mt-2 text-sm leading-8">
            Before you can place orders for Items using our Application, you need to open a canari super app account. When you open an account you may create a password, or other secure login method, and may also have to provide credit card details. You must keep any password you create, or other secure login method, secret, and prevent others from accessing your email account or mobile phone. If another person uses these methods to access your account, you will be responsible to pay for any Items they order, and we are not responsible for any other losses you suffer, unless the person using your password obtained it because we did not keep it secure.<br>
            You may close your account at any time by requesting to do so in your account section of our website or contacting us using the contact details above. We may suspend your access to your account, or close it permanently, if we believe that your account has been used by someone else. We may also close your account if in our opinion you are abusing our Service (for example, by applying for refunds or credit to which we do not consider you are entitled, making repeated unreasonable complaints, mistreating riders, or any other good reason). If we close your account permanently we will refund any remaining account credit you have validly obtained from our customer service team or Application following any issue by applying a credit to your registered credit card, or if that is not possible for any reason, by way of a bank transfer using bank details (provided you have supplied them to us).
         </p>

         <p class="mt-6 text-base font-semibold leading-7 text-orange">Service Availability</p>
          <p class="mt-2 text-sm leading-8">
            Each Partner Restaurant has a prescribed delivery area. This delivery area may change at any time due to factors such as weather, or demand on our service. This is to ensure that Items reach your door at their best. Our Partner Restaurants each decide their own operating hours. That means that the availability of our Service, and the range of Partner Restaurants from which you can order, depends on the Partner Restaurants in your area. If you try to order a delivery to a location outside the delivery area or operating hours of a Partner Restaurant, or the Application is otherwise unavailable for any reason, we will notify you that ordering will not be possible.
         </p>


         <p class="mt-6 text-base font-semibold leading-7 text-orange">Orders</p>
          <p class="mt-2 text-sm leading-8">
            When you place an order through our Application, it needs to be accepted by us or the Partner Restaurant before it is confirmed. We will send you a notification if your order has been accepted (the “Confirmation Notice”). The contract for the supply of any Item you have ordered comes into existence when we send the Confirmation Notice. You are responsible for paying for all Items ordered using your account, and for related delivery charges, and for complying with these Terms, even if you have ordered the Item for someone else. Deliveroo or some Partner Restaurants operate a minimum order value policy. This will be displayed on our Application. All Items are subject to availability. Partner Restaurants may use nuts or other allergens in the preparation of certain Items. Please contact our Partner Restaurant prior to ordering if you have an allergy. Deliveroo cannot guarantee that any of the Items sold by our Partner Restaurants are free of allergens.
         </p>

         <p class="mt-6 text-base font-semibold leading-7 text-orange">Delivery</p>
          <p class="mt-2 text-sm leading-8">
            When you place an order you will have the choice to place it as an ASAP Delivery or a Scheduled Delivery. For an ASAP Delivery, we will tell you an estimated delivery time for your Item before you place the order, but we will attempt delivery as soon as possible; you must therefore be available to accept delivery from the time you place the order. For a Scheduled Delivery, we will tell you the time when the Item is expected to be delivered; you must be available to accept delivery for ten minutes before and ten minutes after that time.<br>
            Unfortunately, despite our, and our Partner Restaurant’s best efforts, things do not always go to plan and factors such as traffic and weather conditions may prevent us from delivering your Item on time. If your order is more than 20 minutes late, and we haven’t notified you giving you the option to cancel your order, we will work with you to make things right unless you have caused the delay (e.g. because you gave us the wrong address or did not come to the door).<br>
            We will attempt delivery at the address you provide to us when you place your order. You are responsible to ensure you have included an accurate pin to ensure your Items reach you. If you need to change the delivery location after you have placed your order, we may be able to change to the address to an alternative one that is registered with your account if you let us know before the driver has been dispatched, and the new address is within the same zone as the address you originally ordered your Item to. If we cannot change the delivery address, you have the option to cancel the order, but if food preparation has started you will be charged the full price for the Item, and if the driver has been despatched you will also be charged for delivery.<br>
            You will still be charged for the Item and for delivery in the event of a failed delivery if you have caused such failure for any reason. Reasons you might cause a delivery to fail include (but are not limited to):<br>
            you do not come to the door;<br>
did not pick up the phone when the driver contacted you using the contact information you have provided us; and/or<br>
you picked up the phone but then failed to provide access within a reasonable amount of time, and the driver is unable to find a safe location to leave the food.
